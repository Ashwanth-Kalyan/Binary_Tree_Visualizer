Here‚Äôs an optimized **GitHub README** that effectively describes your binary tree visualizer project:

# Binary Tree Visualizer üå≥

A simple **Binary Tree Visualizer** built with **Python** and **Tkinter** to help you understand the structure and relationships in a binary tree. This project visually displays a binary tree and is ideal for students and learners who want to **grasp binary tree concepts** intuitively.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Features
- **Visualize binary trees** dynamically.
- Displays nodes, edges, and their relationships clearly.
- Customizable to work with any binary tree structure.
- Helps build a strong visual understanding of binary trees.

---

## üìã How It Works
- Each node of the binary tree is displayed as a circle.
- Left and right child nodes are connected to their parent using lines.
- The visualization updates according to the binary tree structure you define in the code.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Binary-Tree-Visualizer.git
   cd Binary-Tree-Visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Ensure Python (>=3.6) is installed on your system.
   - Tkinter is bundled with Python for most installations. To verify:
     ```bash
     python -m tkinter
     ```

3. **Run the code:**
   ```bash
   python binary_tree_visualizer.py
   ```

## üöÄ Example Usage

Here's an example of a binary tree that this visualizer can render:

```python
root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2)
root.right = Node(3)
root.right.right = Node(7)
visualizer = BinaryTreeVisualizer(root)
visualizer.visualize()
```

### Output:
- Node `1` is the root.
- Node `2` is the left child of `1`.
- Node `3` is the right child of `1`.
- Node `7` is the right child of `3`.

This creates a **visual hierarchy** of the tree structure.

## üîß Customization

To visualize your own binary tree:
1. Replace the `Node` definitions with your desired tree structure.
2. Add nodes as left or right children using `Node.left` and `Node.right`.
